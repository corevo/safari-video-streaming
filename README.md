# Safari Video Streaming
This repository serves as an example for [The weird Case of Streaming in Safari](https://corevo.io/the-weird-case-of-video-streaming-in-safari/).  

This example shows how to stream WebM videos in Safari, it is possible as of macOS 11.3.

Mostly based on [video-streaming-example](https://github.com/bootstrapping-microservices/video-streaming-example),
my example is more to my flavor, using newer ECMAScript features and promises.
